# Trash Locator

**Trash Locator** is an app that uses Maps SDK find nearest trash around you from geojson files provided by the opendata from your city.

Sadly the only opendata *trash datasets* files I've found so far are from 3 cities: 
* **Santa Cruz de Tenerife**
* **Cáceres**
* **Washington DC**

Files are on client side, there's no API for such information, but you can always host your server-side and request the data from there✌️!

Currently I'm working on this app to experiment with Maps SDK, but you can already use it 😊
